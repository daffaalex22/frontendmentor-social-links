# Event Listener Basics

This project contains a series of mini-projects designed to teach the fundamentals of JavaScript event listeners. Each mini-project focuses on a specific type of event, providing both starter files for students to build upon and complete examples with solutions.

## How to Use These Projects

### For Students

1. Start with the `starter/` folder in each mini-project
2. Read the HTML and CSS files to understand the structure
3. Complete the TODO comments in the `script.js` file
4. Test your implementation in the browser
5. Compare your solution with the complete example
6. Read the README in each mini-project for additional exercises

### For Instructors

1. Use the starter files as exercises for students
2. Use the complete examples as solutions or demonstrations
3. Encourage students to experiment with the extension ideas
4. Have students create their own mini-projects using the concepts learned

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Basic knowledge of CSS
- Understanding of JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, etc.)

## Learning Path

1. Start with the **Click Event** mini-project to learn the basics of event listeners
2. Move to **MouseEnter Event** to understand hover interactions
3. Continue with **MouseLeave Event** to complete the hover experience
4. Finish with **KeyDown Event** to learn keyboard interactions

## Browser Compatibility

All event listeners used in these projects are widely supported in modern browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
